# Flash Flags

A web application for vexillologists who want to learn more about flags and countries around the world.

## Why I Built This

The idea for this web application came about when I discovered a social media trend of people testing their knowledge of random flags from various different countries. I was a lot less knowledgeable than I would've hoped and so were many others. Nonetheless, I thought it was a fun challenge, and when it was time to research, I came across a robust Countries API that I was excited to incorporate. 

From then on, I decided to build an entire web application based on this trend for people looking to improve their knowledge of flags from all over the world. And that is how Flash Flags was born!
